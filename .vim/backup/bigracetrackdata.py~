#This program will scan through and collate all the data that evan took as an undergrad on the racetrack project.

#He has saved them in the following directory structure
#/mnt/e/RaceTrack/Data/$DATE$/FILM$FILMNUMBER$/$VOLTAGE$/t1valuematrix.csv

#and what I need is the average velocity (or max velocity of the film) and the voltage of the flowmeter. These are the two important variables. 

#You can't be sure that the path is exactly that, some folders have more in the their chains. But as far as I can tell it is always $VOLTAGE$/t1valuematrix.csv

#So, this should be a fairly straightforward regex process

#Program:
#1. Search for all files named t1valuematrix.csv
#2. Extract voltage from path name
#3. For each file:
#a. plot the velocity profile (to make sure the data is good)
#b. record the average velocity
#c. record the max velocity
#d. record the date
#e. plot all average velocity vs voltage
#f. plot all average velocity vs voltage with numbers as points (do outlier check)
#g. make nice plot
#h. make differences plot

#I am going to aim to do 1 and 2 today
